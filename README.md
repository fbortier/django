## What is Django?

![What is Django](images/slide2.png)
Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It is intended to enable developers to quickly construct, scalable, and secure web applications. Django follows MTV (Model-View-Template) architectural patterns. Thus, it is very easy to separate the data layer (model) from the user interface (template) and business logic (view).

Django has built-in ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for handling databases, an admin panel for handling content, out-of-the-box permission and authentication support, and form handling, URL routing, amongst many other tools. It stresses a lot on security, so protection against the common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is there.

## Why use Django?

![Why use Django?](images/slide4.png)
- **MVT Architecture**: Django follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) pattern which allows for the code to be organized efficiently. In Django, the model represent the data and logic. The view describes how the request is processed and how the reponse will be return. The template takes care of the HTMLs. This separation makes Django applications modular and easier to maintain.
- **Built-in ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**: Django's ORM allows the programmer to communicate with the database through Python instead of SQL. It provides an abstraction layer on top of the database; manipulating it directly is thus easier and even safer. Meanwhile, it supports many databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and Oracle.
- **Template Engine and URL Routing**: Django provides a strong template engine for dynamically creating HTML that supports reusable components out of the box. The URL routing system allows developers to map URLs to views with ease and makes URL management easier and customizable.
- **Built-in Admin Interface**: Django itself creates an administration interface that manages the data which is highly customizable. An administrator will then be able to perform CRUD (create, read, update and delete) via the Web interface without extra coding hence saving development time.
- **Strong Security Feature**: Django emphasizes security a lot. Security against common web attacks, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF), is implemented. It also allows by default some good practices which will make your application a bit more robust in security terms.

These features make Django a popular choice for developers who want to build secure, maintainable, and scalable web applications efficiently.
## Key Benefits of Django
![Key Benefits of Djang0](images/slide5.png)
- **Rapid Development**: Fundamentally, the core of Django allows the developer to cut down the development time by reusing code components, proper project structure, and a large number of behind-the-scenes modules. Thus, more time will be spent on the creative part rather than the repetitions.
- **Secure by Design**: Django is designed with security in mind. It tries to help developers eliminate common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XXS), or cross-site request forgery (CSRF). With Django, developers can take advantage of its prebuilt security features, guided by the best practices for security.
- **Scalability**: Django is built for large-scale applications and can handle high traffic loads efficiently. The architecture in Django was such that the component-based design makes it very suitable for smaller projects, too, as for complex applications with considerable traffic.
- **Versatile**: Django can use several database back-ends and is extremely friendly to a Python coder hence it will be easy to shift to another database if needed. Such versatility allows Django to be applied both for a content management system and a scientific computation platform.

These benefits make Django a robust choice for developers aiming to build scalable, secure, and adaptable web applications.
## Djangos Popularity
![Djangos Popularity](images/slide6.png)
In the 2024 Developer Survey by Stack Overflow, Django retains a place right in the middle of other web frameworks and technologies, holding a sizeable 12% usage rate. That makes Django one of the leading ones in web development, especially in back-end development. Its stable position, however, keeps it from falling down the list for its power, security, and adaptability. This continues to prove relevant and useful to developers who want to use a powerful, documented, community-supported system of frameworks to create large-scale Web applications.
## Resources and Capabilities of Django
![Resources and Capabilities of Django](images/slide7.png)
- **Authentication**: Django boasts of a high-feature authentication-and-permission system that makes user account, session, and permission management so easy; this surely counts among those features that immediately become indispensable while developing applications requiring user log-ins and other related access controls.
- **Site Maps**: Django supports site maps out of the box: XML files that give search engines hints about the structure of your site and improve your SEO (Search Engine Optimization) - making sure people see the correct indexing of your content.
- **RSS Feeds (Really Simple Syndication)**: Django provides tools for constructing RSS feeds, which enable subscribers to receive instant updates when the publishers add fresh content. This is particularly useful for content-heavy applications such as blogs or news sites.
- **Building Content Management Systems (CMS)**: As Django is modular and flexible, it is the most appropriate framework for developing customized content management systems, where the administration can edit site contents without having to code.
- **Building Real-Time Applications**: Django will enable real-time applications by integrating other frameworks that support features like WebSockets and allow for asynchronous communication; hence, it is suitable for implementation in chat applications or live notifications.

These resources make Django a powerful framework for developers who need comprehensive tools to build and manage complex web applications.
## Security
![Security](images/slide8.png)
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protecting**: Django provides built-in protections against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, where malicious scripts are injected into web pages viewed by other users. Djangoâ€™s template system automatically escapes input data, helping to prevent these types of attacks and ensuring that user-generated content is handled securely.
- **SQL Injection Protection (Object-Relational Mapping - ORM)**: Django's ORM allows the developer to interact with the database by writing Python code, thus reducing the possibility of SQL injection vulnerabilities by a big margin. Django's ORM prevents bad SQL command execution by an attacker via its usage of parameterized queries and encapsulation of raw SQL.
- **Strong Password Hashing**: Django comes with a very strong password hashing engine that stores passwords very securely. Django uses algorithms like PBKDF2 (
PBKDF2, or Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) out of the box, while the configuration for even stronger algorithms is available, should this ever be required. This makes the retrieval of actual passwords quite impossible for attackers if an attacker succeeds in accessing the database.

These security features make Django a secure framework choice, as it is designed to protect applications against common web vulnerabilities and promote secure coding practices.
## Important Features of Django
![Important Features of Django](images/slide9.png)
- **Really Fast Implementation**: Django is designed in a modular fashion for rapid development. It provides the developer with batteries-included tools that allow rapid feature implementation without code duplication, hence ideal for projects that have to be done in the shortest time.
- **Allows You to Build Secure Apps**: Django takes into consideration security concerns seriously and provides some built-in protection for common vulnerabilities: it offers authentication, prevents SQL injection, and protects against XSS attacks, among others, mostly out of the box.
- **Easy to Scale**: The architecture of Django is scaled easily, due to which it fits in both small and big applications. Its flexibility and the support of different database backends and caching solutions make Django applications scalable with growing demands.
- **Incredibly Versatile**: Everything from simple websites to complex enterprise-level solutions can be developed with Django. That makes Django flexible, because there is a great ecosystem of libraries and plugins for almost any need.
- **Automatically Creates Admin Interface**: Some of the powerful features included in Django are the ready-wear admin interface; this saves a lot of time and other resources since the developers will not be bothering themselves building up any admin system. It's also highly customizable, mainly for different applications.

These features make Django a powerful and efficient framework, ideal for building secure, scalable, and versatile applications.
## Drawbacks of Django
![Drawbacks of Django](images/slide11-14.png)
- **Monolitihic Concept**: Well, Django is a monolithic framework, meaning it is all in one and tightly integrated. In such a design, while a lot can be brought under one roof, there is limited flexibility in case they really want to customize or swap in other parts. In some ways, it may not be the best fit for microservices-based systems, in which a structure built from independent, loosely coupled components is preferred.
- **Steep Learning Curve**: Django is quite overwhelming for a beginner, especially if they are absolutely new-both to web development and even Python. Since Django is structured and opinionated, it takes quite a while to learn models, views, templates, and middleware. New developers cannot take in all those aspects, so the learning curve is steep initially.
- **Not Suitable for Small Projects**: Django's feature set is much too big for a small project. For those applications where there are only a few pages or basic functionality, the setup which Django does is just unnecessary and resource-consuming. In such light projects, one can use smaller frameworks or even microframeworks, like Flask.
- **Slow Development for Simple Applications**: Due to its structured nature and big size, setting a Django project is time-consuming and, therefore, affects the pace of development for smaller applications. While it's one of the best frameworks for big and complex projects, structure and setup time impede rapid development when creating quick minimal apps.

These points highlight some of Djangoâ€™s limitations, particularly when flexibility, simplicity, or quick setup is needed for smaller or simpler applications.
## Companies who have used Django
![Companies who have used Django](images/slide15.png)
- **Instagram**: Instagram had chosen Django to develop its web application for the first time because Django had the advantage of fast development and was scalable. Hence, Django enabled Instagram to handle high traffic and rapidly deploy new features as the site was scaling up, making it very apt an excellent choice for a social networking site with hundreds of millions of users.
- **Spotify**: Spotify relies on Django for the complete backend of the web application, as it's handier to work with complex data and gives good interoperability with other systems. It scales and is flexible enough to handle a great quantity of information with intensive user interactions.
- **Pinterest**: Pinterest used Django when it was starting, which had the advantage of quickly setting up with a solid framework. For instance, Django allowed Pinterest to grow rapidly by handling millions of active users who can upload images and interact with other users in numerous ways.
- **NASA**: NASA has used Django in some internal projects, relying on safety features and the capability of Django to handle very complicated data structures. Stability and robustness make Django suitable for mission-critical applications where reliability is crucial.

These examples highlight Djangoâ€™s versatility and scalability, making it a popular choice among high-profile companies for building complex and secure applications.
## Django vs. Flask 
![Django vs. Flask](images/slide16.png)
1. Type: 
    - Django: A full-stack framework, meaning it provides a complete set of tools and components to build complex web applications out of the box.
    - Flask: A micro-framework, offering a lightweight and minimal approach, allowing developers to add extensions as needed.
2. Built-in Feature:
    - Django: Comes with many built-in features like an admin interface, ORM, and authentication system, making it suitable for large applications with complex requirements.
    - Flask: Offers minimal built-in functionality, relying on extensions for features like authentication and ORM, giving developers more control over components.
3. Flexibility: 
    - Django: Less flexible due to its "batteries-included" philosophy and opinionated structure, which may restrict customization.
    - Flask: Highly flexible, allowing developers to choose and integrate components as they wish, making it ideal for custom setups.
4. Development Speed:
    - Django: Fast for large applications due to its comprehensive features and tools, enabling quicker implementation of complex functionality.
    - Flask: Fast for small applications, as it has minimal setup and allows rapid development for simple projects.
5. Complexity: 
    - Django: Can be complex for small tasks due to its structured and feature-rich design, which might be overwhelming for simple projects.
    - Flask: Simple and easy to understand, making it more accessible for small projects and straightforward applications.
6. Community and Ecosystem:
    - Django: Has a large community with many plugins and resources available, making it easier to find support and extend functionality.
    - Flask: Has a growing community, but fewer built-in options and plugins, though itâ€™s gaining popularity due to its simplicity and flexibility.
7. Learning Curve:
    - Django: Has a steeper learning curve, especially for beginners, due to its structured approach and multiple built-in components.
    - Flask: Gentler for new developers, as it is more straightforward and requires less knowledge of complex components.

In summary, Django is ideal for larger, more complex projects that require a robust framework with built-in tools, while Flask is better suited for smaller, simpler projects or when greater flexibility is desired.

# Tutorial on AngularJS

In this document, I'm gonna talk a little bit about what AngularJS actually is, why we use it, and what you're gonna be learning.

## Introduction to AngularJS

AngularJS is an **MVC-style JavaScript framework** for creating **single-page, data-driven applications**. **MVC** stands for **Model-View-Controller**, a design pattern that separates our data logic from our HTML output, making things easier as we develop our application.

Since AngularJS is a framework, we need to structure our code according to its requirements. Its features include:

- **Two-Way Data Binding**
- **Robust Templating System**
- **Seamless DOM Interaction**
- **Filters for Data Display Adjustments**
- **Directives that Expand HTML Functionality**

## Learning Objectives

In this tutorial, I'm going to cover the following topics:

- Understanding MVC in the context of AngularJS.
- Exploring two-way data binding and how it works.
- Diving into filters, directives, and expressions.
- Learning about controllers and how they help us manage data.
- Setting up routes and views to create a single-page application.
- Implementing form validation with AngularJS.
- Building a quiz app from scratch to put it all into practice.

## Prerequisites

Here's what you're going to need to know beforehand:

- **JavaScript**
- **HTML**
- **CSS** (Optional but advised)
- **JSON** (Optional but advised)

## MVC Architecture

AngularJS uses the **MVC architecture** to build web applications by dividing them into three main components:

### Model

Think of the model as data. For instance:

- JSON data
- Data from databases
- Data from external services (APIs)

### View

Used to display content and data to a user in a browser. Use expressions to insert data into views:


`<!-- Example of inserting data into a view -->`

>\<p>\{\{ data \}\}</p>










### Controller

Controllers handle the interaction between models and views, responding to actions and updating views with model data. They're the bridge that connects everything, ensuring smooth data flow.

We can have different controllers for different parts of our application, like a registration controller for signing up users or a contact controller to process contact form data.

**Example**

Suppose a user submits a contact form. The controller detects the form submission, retrieves the input data (like name and email) from the model, and processes it. Then, it updates the view to show a "Thank you" message. While the user only sees the final message, the controller handles everything behind the scenes, managing data flow between the model and view.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

In this section, I'm going to show you how to set up our development environment. You do not have to follow along at this stage if you do not want to, as we will start building the project from the **Building the Quiz Application section**, but it is advisable.

If you want to start to build the project please head to [Building the Quiz Application](#building-the-quiz-application)

### Including AngularJS via CDN

Instead of downloading AngularJS and dealing with local files, we can include it directly using a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

1.  Include AngularJS in Your HTML

    Open your index.html file. In the <head> section, add the following script tag:

    ```Javascript
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.8.2/angular.min.js"></script>
    ```

    Your index.html should look like this:

    ```HTML
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html ng-app>
    <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Your AngularJS App</title>
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.8.2/angular.min.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

    Notes:

    - **_ng-app_**: This attribute initializes your AngularJS application. Placing it in the `<html>` tag tells AngularJS that the entire page is part of the app.
    - **_Script in `<head>`_**: Unlike other scripts that you might place at the end of the `<body>`, AngularJS should be included in the `<head>` because it needs to load before the content to properly set up the templating and data binding.

2.  Include Additional Modules

    We'll add the AngularJS routing module to our application because we will be using it.

    Add the following script tag right after the main AngularJS script in your `<head>` section:

    ```Javascript
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.8.2/angular-route.min.js"></script>
    ```

    Now your index.html file should look like this:

    ```HTML
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html ng-app>
    <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Your AngularJS App</title>
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.8.2/angular.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.8.2/angular-route.min.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

## Two-Way Data Binding

Two-way data binding is one of the coolest features in AngularJS.

For More Details [AngularJS Data Binding](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/databinding)

1. Add the following code between the `<body>` tags:

   > \<h1>Two-Way Data Binding Example\</h1>  
   > \<input type="text" ng-model="car" placeholder="Enter your favorite car">  
   > \<p>Your favorite car is: \{\{ car \}\}</p>  

   - **_ng-model:_** The `ng-model` directive binds the input field to a model (data variable). So, whatever you type into the input field is stored in the `car` variable.

   **_Expressions:_** We are using double curly braces to display the value of `car` in real time.




   Completed code:

   > \<!DOCTYPE html>  
   > \<html ng-app>  
   > \<head>  
   > \<meta charset="UTF-8">  
   > \<title>Your AngularJS App\</title>  
   > \<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.8.2/angular.min.js">\</script>  
   > \<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.8.2/angular-route.min.js">\</script>  
   > \</head>  
   > \<body>  
   > \<h1>Two-Way Data Binding Example\</h1>  
   > \<input type="text" ng-model="car" placeholder="Enter your favorite car">  
   > \<p>Your favorite car is: \{\{ car \}\}</p>  
   > \</body>  
   > \</html>  


Now, as you type into the input field, the paragraph below it updates automatically to show your input. This is called two-way data binding.

It's an efficient way to avoid writing additional JavaScript code.

## Directives

Directives are a fundamental part of AngularJS that let you extend the functionality of HTML. They tell AngularJS to perform specific behaviors on elements in your application. We have already used two directives in the previous section.

For More Details: [AngularJS Directives](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive)

**Common Directives**

- **_ng-app_**

  Tells AngularJS that everything inside the `<html> `tags is part of the Angular application.

  Reference: [ngApp Directive](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive)

- **_ng-model_**

  Binds input fields to models, allowing for two-way data binding.

  Reference: [ngModel Directive](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngModel)

- **_ng-repeat_**

  Repeats a set of HTML elements for each item in a collection.

  Reference: [ ngRepeat Directive](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngRepeat)

> \<ul>  
>   \<li ng-repeat="car in cars">  
>     \{\{ car \}\}  
>   \</li>  
> \</ul>


- **_ng-include_**

  Includes an external HTML fragment (partial) into your main file.

  Reference: [ngInclude Directive](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngInclude)

  ```HTML
  <!-- Main HTML file -->
  <div ng-include="'header.html'"></div>
  ```

  ```HTML
  <!-- header.html -->
  <header>
  <h1>My Application</h1>
  <!-- Navigation links -->
  </header>
  ```

- **_ng-show_**

  Displays an element when the expression evaluates to true.

  Reference: [ngShow Directive](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngShow)

  ```HTML
  <div ng-show="isLoggedIn">
  <p>Welcome back, user!</p>
  </div>
  ```

- **_ng-hide_**

  Hides an element when the expression evaluates to true.

  Reference: [ngHide Directive](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngHide)

  ```HTML
  <div ng-show="isLoggedIn">
  <p>Welcome back, user!</p>
  </div>
  ```

- **_ng-click_**

  Executes code when an element is clicked.

  Reference: [ngClick Directive](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngClick)

  ```HTML
  <button ng-click="count = count + 1">Click me!</button>
  ```

- **_ng-submit_**

  Binds AngularJS functions to the submit event of a form.

  Reference: [ngSubmit Directive](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngSubmit)

  ```HTML
  <form ng-submit="addItem()">
  <input type="text" ng-model="newItem" placeholder="Add item" required>
  <button type="submit">Add</button>
  </form>
  ```

- **_ng-srct_**

  Ensures the correct image source is set after AngularJS has evaluated the expression, preventing errors.

  Reference: [ngSrc Directive](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngSrc)

> \<img ng-src="\{\{ imageUrl \}\}" alt="Dynamic Image">


Directives can be used in different forms, not just as attributes. While we've seen them as attributes so far, they can also be custom HTML elements.

## Expressions

Expressions in AngularJS are like little snippets of JavaScript code that you can place in your HTML to display dynamic data. They're usually enclosed within double curly braces {{ }}.

For More Details [AngularJS Expressions](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/expression)

**Basic Usage**

- You can perform calculations directly in your HTML:

  > \<p>\{\{ 5 * 5 \}\}</p>

- You can also concatenate strings:

  > \<p>\{\{ 'Hello, ' + 'Peter!' \}\}</p>

**Using Variables**

- Let's initialize some data using the `ng-init` directive (in real applications, you'd use controllers, but we'll use `ng-init` for simplicity):

  > \<body ng-app ng-init="numbers=[1,2,3,4,5]; cars=['Mercedes','BMW','Audi']">

  Now you can access this data in your expressions.

- Access array elements:

  > \<p>First number: \{\{ numbers[0] \}\}</p> <!-- Outputs 1 -->

- Perform operations:

  > \<p>Sum: \{\{ numbers[0] + numbers[3] \}\}</p> <!-- Outputs 5 -->

- Use strings from arrays:

  > \<p>Do you like \{\{ cars[1] \}\} and \{\{ cars[2] \}\}?</p> <!-- Outputs 'Do you like BMW and Audi?' -->

**Expressions in Attributes**

You can use expressions within HTML attributes to make them dynamic.

- Dynamic Class Assignment  
  Let's set a color variable:

  > \<body ng-app ng-init="color='red'">

- Use it in your HTML:

  > \<p class="\{\{ color \}\}">This text will be styled based on the color class.</p>


Expressions allow you to easily display and manipulate data in your views.

## Modules

As our application grows, we need a way to organize our code into manageable chunks. In AngularJS, we use modules to achieve this.

An application can have one module or many, depending on the size of your app and how you like to organize your code.

For More Details [AngularJS Modules](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/module)

**Creating a Module**

Let's create a module for our application. We'll call it myPeterApp. To define a module in AngularJS, we use the angular.module method.

1. Create a new JavaScript file called app.js in your project folder:

   ```Javascript
   // app.js
   let myPeterApp = angular.module('myPeterApp', []);
   ```

   In the code above:

   - **_myPeterApp_**: We store the module in a variable, which allows us to reference it later when adding components like controllers.

   - **_angular.module('myPeterApp', [])_**: We create a new module named 'myPeterApp'. The second parameter is an array of dependencies for this module. Right now, we don't have any dependencies, so we pass an empty array [].

2. Linking the Module to the HTML

   Next, we need to tell AngularJS that this module is the main module for our application. We do this by updating the ng-app directive in our index.html file.

   ```HTML
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html ng-app="myPeterApp">
   <head>
   <meta charset="UTF-8">
   <title>Your AngularJS App</title>
   <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.8.2/angular.min.js"></script>
   <script src="app.js"></script>
   </head>
   <body>
   <!-- Your content goes here -->
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

   - **_ng-app="myPeterApp"_**: We set the ng-app directive to the name of our module, so AngularJS knows which module to use for this application.

   - **_`<script src="app.js"></script>`_**: We include our app.js file where we defined the module.

**Adding Components to the Module**

Now that we have a module, we can start adding components to it, such as controllers, services, and directives.

1. For example, we can define a controller within our module:

   ```Javascript
   // app.js
   let myPeterApp = angular.module('myPeterApp', []);

   myPeterApp.controller('peterController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
   $scope.message = 'Welcome to the Peter Directory!';
   $scope.frameworks = ['ReactJS', 'NextJS', 'RemixJS', 'AngularJS'];
   }]);
   ```

   - **_myPeterApp.controller('peterController', ['$scope', function($scope) { ... }])_**: We define a controller named 'peterController' within our 'myPeterApp' module.

   - **_$scope.message_**: We add a property message to the $scope object.

   - **_scope.frameworks_**: We add a frameworks array to the $scope.

2. Using the Controller in HTML

   We can use this controller in our HTML as follows:

   > \<body ng-app="myPeterApp">  
   > \<div ng-controller="peterController">  
   >     \<p>\{\{ message \}\}</p>  
   >     \<ul>  
   >     \<li ng-repeat="framework in frameworks">\{\{ framework \}\}</li>  
   >     \</ul>  
   > \</div>  
   > \</body>  

   - **_ng-controller="peterController"_**: Attaches the `peterController` to this `<div>` element.

   - **_\{\{ message \}\}_**: Displays the message from the `$scope` in our controller.

   - **_ng-repeat_**: Repeats the list item for each framework in the `frameworks` array.

By structuring our application with modules, we gain better control over our codebase, making it easier to maintain and scale as our application grows.

## Controllers

In AngularJS, controllers are used to control the data of your application. They are the bridge between the view (HTML) and the model (data), handling the interaction between the user and the app. Controllers are defined using JavaScript and are responsible for:

- Initializing the model data.
- Adding behaviors to the `$scope` object.
- Exposing functions and variables to the view.

For More Details [AngularJS Controllers](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/controller)

**Creating a Controller**

Let's create a controller named `peterController` within our module `myPeterApp`.

1. Define the Controller in `app.js`:

   > // app.js  
   > let myPeterApp = angular.module('myPeterApp', []);  
   >  
   > myPeterApp.controller('peterController', ['$scope', function($scope) {  
   > $scope.message = 'Frameworks';  
   > $scope.frameworks = ['ReactJS', 'NextJS', 'RemixJS', 'AngularJS'];  
   > }]);  

2. Linking the Controller to the HTML

   In your `index.html` file, link the controller to a specific part of your HTML using the `ng-controller` directive.

   > \<!DOCTYPE html>  
   > \<html ng-app="myPeterApp">  
   > \<head>  
   > \<meta charset="UTF-8">  
   > \<title>Your AngularJS App</title>

   >     \</ul>  
   > \</div>  
   > \</body>  
   > \</html>  


**Understanding $scope**

The $scope object is a special object that connects your controller with your view. Any properties or methods attached to $scope become available to use in your HTML.

**Scope Hierarchy**

The scope of a controller is limited to the HTML element it's attached to and its child elements. Variables and functions defined on the $scope are not accessible outside of this scope.

**Example:**

If you try to access {{ message }} outside the` <div ng-controller="peterController">`, it will not display anything because it's not within the controller's scope.

For more details on scope, head over to this URL: [AngularJS Scope](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/scope)

## Filters

In AngularJS, filters are used to modify or format data before displaying it to the user. They can transform data within expressions and directives in your templates, without changing the underlying data in the controller.

For more details: [AngularJS Filters](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/filter)

**Using Filters in Expressions**

- Filters are applied using the pipe symbol `|` followed by the filter name.

  **Example Syntax**:
  
  &#123;&#123; `expression | filter1 | filter2` &#125;&#125;

**Common Built-in Filters**

- orderBy

- filter

- currency

- limitTo

- uppercase / lowercase

  **_Example_**

<p>&#123;&#123; message `|` uppercase &#125;&#125;</p> <!-- Converts message to uppercase -->

## Views and Routing

As our AngularJS application grows, we'll need to manage multiple views and navigate between them seamlessly. AngularJS uses routing to handle this in single-page applications, allowing us to load different views without reloading the entire page.

**Setting Up Views**

First, we'll create separate HTML files for each view inside a views folder.

1. views/home.html

   ```HTML
   <h1>Home Page</h1>
   <p>Welcome to the Peter Directory App!</p>
   ```

2. views/directory.html

   > \<div ng-controller="peterController">  
   > \<h2>\{\{ message \}\}</h2>  
   > \<ul>  
   >     \<li ng-repeat="framework in frameworks">\{\{ framework \}\}</li>  
   > \</ul>  
   > \</div>  


**Configuring Routes**

To enable routing, include the AngularJS routing module in your project.

1. nclude angular-route.min.js

   ```Javascript
   <!-- index.html -->
   <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.8.2/angular-route.min.js"></script>
   ```

2. Add 'ngRoute' as a Dependency

   ```Javascript
   // app.js
   let myPeterApp = angular.module('myPeterApp', ['ngRoute']);
   ```

3. Set Up Routes in the Config Function

   ```Javascript
   // app.js
   myPeterApp.config(['$routeProvider', function($routeProvider) {
   $routeProvider
       .when('/home', {
       templateUrl: 'views/home.html'
       })
       .when('/directory', {
       templateUrl: 'views/directory.html',
       controller: 'peterController'
       })
       .otherwise({
       redirectTo: '/home'
       });
   }]);
   ```

4. Using ng-view

   In your index.html, specify where to inject the views using the ng-view directive.

   ```HTML
   <!-- index.html -->
   <body>
   <header>
       <!-- Navigation Links -->
       <ul>
       <li><a href="#/home">Home</a></li>
       <li><a href="#/directory">Directory</a></li>
       </ul>
   </header>

   <!-- Main Content Area -->
   <main ng-view></main>
   </body>
   ```

By setting up views and routing, we've structured our application to handle multiple pages smoothly, enhancing user experience without full page reloads.

## Form Validation

AngularJS provides robust form validation features that enhance user experience by offering immediate feedback on form inputs.

For More Details [AngularJS Froms](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/forms)

**Setting Up the Form**

1. Create a contact form in your contact.html view

   ```HTML
   <!-- contact.html -->
   <div class="content">
   <form name="contactForm" novalidate>
       <!-- Name Field -->
       <input type="text" name="name" ng-model="contact.name" placeholder="Name" ng-required="true">
       <div ng-show="contactForm.name.$touched && contactForm.name.$invalid">
       <small class="error">Please enter your name.</small>
       </div>

       <!-- Email Field -->
       <input type="email" name="email" ng-model="contact.email" placeholder="Email" ng-required="true">
       <div ng-show="contactForm.email.$touched && contactForm.email.$invalid">
       <small class="error">Please enter a valid email address.</small>
       </div>

       <!-- Message Field -->
       <textarea name="message" ng-model="contact.message" placeholder="Message" ng-required="true"></textarea>
       <div ng-show="contactForm.message.$touched && contactForm.message.$invalid">
       <small class="error">Please enter your message.</small>
       </div>

       <!-- Submit Button -->
       <input type="submit" value="Send" ng-disabled="contactForm.$invalid">
   </form>
   </div>
   ```

   - **_novalidate_**: Disables default HTML5 validation to let AngularJS handle it.

   - **_ng-model_**: Binds form fields to the contact object.

   - **_Error Messages_**: Displayed using ng-show when fields are touched and invalid.

   - **_Submit Button_**: Disabled using ng-disabled if the form is invalid.

2. Add CSS to style invalid fields and error messages

   ```CSS
   /* styles.css */
   input.ng-invalid.ng-touched,
   textarea.ng-invalid.ng-touched {
   border: 2px solid red;
   }

   .error {
   color: red;
   display: block;
   text-align: center;
   }

   input[disabled],
   textarea[disabled] {
   opacity: 0.5;
   cursor: not-allowed;
   }
   ```

By utilizing AngularJS's form validation features, you can create interactive and user-friendly forms that guide users to provide correct input, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Building the Quiz Application

Okay, so once we know the basics of AngularJS, let's start building our first project.

Open up your favorite text editor, I am going to be using visual studio code for this matter.

**Folder structure**

1.  **Create three folders and a file in your root directory.**

    - **_views_**

    - **controllers**

    - **module**

    - **index.html**

      Your project should look like this

      ![layout](images/project-layout.png)

2.  **Creating files in the directories that have been previously created.**

    - **In the controllers folder**, create three files, loginController.js, menuController.js and quizController.js.

    - **In the module folder**, create a file, call it app.js

    - **In the views folder**, create three files, login.html, menu.html and quiz.html.

      Your file structure should look like this

      ![file structure](images/file-structure.png)

3.  **Linking the javascript files and the tailwindCSS to the index.html.**
    - First include the Tailwind CSS in the heading section to link the styles sheet to the index.html file 
      ```HTML
      <!-- Linking Tailwind css -->
     <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
      ```

    With the folder structure you've established, you need to include your AngularJS application script and controller scripts in your index.html file. Here's how you can do it:

    - Now, include the AngularJS core library and the ngRoute module from the Google CDN in the `<head`> section of your index.html file

      ```HTML
      <!-- Include AngularJS core library -->
      <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.8.2/angular.min.js"></script>
      <!-- Include AngularJS ngRoute module -->
      <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.8.2/angular-route.js"></script>
      ```

    - Next, include your app.js file, which is located in the module folder. This file initializes your AngularJS application module

      ```HTML
      <!-- Include the AngularJS application script -->
      <script src="module/app.js"></script>
      ```

    - Then, include your controller scripts, which are located in the controllers folder

      ```HTML
      <!-- Include controller scripts -->
      <script src="controllers/loginController.js"></script>
      <script src="controllers/menuController.js"></script>
      <script src="controllers/quizController.js"></script>
      ```
    - Also, include the ng-app attribute in the html tag and assign it to the quizApp
       ```HTML
      <!-- Include module -->
      <html lang="en" ng-app="quizApp">
      ```
    - Also, include the ng-view in a div tag in the body
       ```HTML
      <!-- Include ng-view -->
      <div ng-view></div>
      ```
       
      
      Your index.html file should now look like this

      ```HTML
      <!-- index.html -->
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html lang="en" ng-app="quizApp">
      <head>
          <meta charset="UTF-8" />
          <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
          <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
          <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
          <!-- Include AngularJS -->
          <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.8.2/angular.min.js"></script>
          <!-- Include ngRoute module -->
          <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.8.2/angular-route.js"></script>
          <!-- Include the AngularJS application script -->
          <script src="./module/app.js"></script>
          <!-- Include controller scripts -->
          <script src="controllers/loginController.js"></script>
          <script src="controllers/menuController.js"></script>
          <script src="controllers/quizController.js"></script>
          <title>Quiz Application</title>
      </head>
      <body>
          <!-- Main container where views will be loaded -->
          <div ng-view></div>
      </body>
      </html>
      ```

5.  **Setting Up app.js**

    Now that we've linked all our JavaScript files in index.html, the next step is to define our AngularJS application module and configure the routes. We'll also create a custom filter to use within our app.

    - In the module folder, open app.js and start by initializing your AngularJS application module

      ```Javascript
      // app.js
      let app = angular.module("quizApp", ["ngRoute"]);
      ```

      **_angular.module("quizApp", ["ngRoute"])_**: This line creates a new AngularJS module named quizApp and injects the ngRoute dependency for routing.

      **_let app =_**: We assign the module to a variable app so we can reference it later when defining configurations, controllers, filters, etc.

    - Next, set up the routing configuration for your application using the $routeProvider service

      ```Javascript
      app.config(function ($routeProvider) {
      $routeProvider
          .when("/", {
          templateUrl: "./views/login.html",
          controller: "loginController",
          })
          .when("/menu", {
          templateUrl: "./views/menu.html",
          controller: "menuController",
          })
          .when("/quiz", {
          templateUrl: "./views/quiz.html",
          controller: "quizController",
          })
          .otherwise({
          redirectTo: "/",
          });
      });
      ```

      In the routing setup, the login route ("/") uses the login.html template with the loginController, letting users enter their name and email to start the quiz. The menu route ("/menu") loads menu.html with the menuController, where users can choose quiz settings like category and difficulty. The quiz route ("/quiz") displays quiz.html using the quizController to show the quiz questions and handle user interactions. If someone tries to go to a page that doesnâ€™t exist, the app will automatically send them back to the login page. Make sure the templateUrl paths correctly point to your view files in the views folder since index.html is in the root directory.

    - I created a capitalize filter to automatically capitalize the first letter of a string, making our text look neat and consistent.

      ```Javascript
      // Custom capitalize filter
      app.filter("capitalize", function () {
      return function (input) {
          if (input != null) {
          input = input.toLowerCase();
          return input.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + input.slice(1);
          }
          return "";
      };
      });
      ```

      Your app.js file should look like this.

      ```Javascript
        // app.js
        let app = angular.module("quizApp", ["ngRoute"]);

        app.config(function ($routeProvider) {
        $routeProvider
            .when("/", {
            templateUrl: "./views/login.html",
            controller: "loginController",
            })
            .when("/menu", {
            templateUrl: "./views/menu.html",
            controller: "menuController",
            })
            .when("/quiz", {
            templateUrl: "./views/quiz.html",
            controller: "quizController",
            })
            .otherwise({
            redirectTo: "/",
            });
        });

        // Custom capitalize filter
        app.filter("capitalize", function () {
        return function (input) {
            if (input != null) {
            input = input.toLowerCase();
            return input.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + input.slice(1);
            }
            return "";
        };
        });
      ```

6.  **Modify the loginController.js File**

    First, navigate to the controllers folder you created earlier and open the file named loginController.js. This file will contain all the logic related to user login.

    - Open loginController.js and add the following code

      ```Javascript
      // controllers/loginController.js
      angular.module("quizApp").controller("loginController", function ($scope, $location) {
      $scope.user = {};
      $scope.validationMessage = "";

      $scope.submitLogin = function () {
          var userName = $scope.user.name;
          var email = $scope.user.email;

          if (!email || email.indexOf("@") === -1) {
          $scope.validationMessage = "Please enter a valid email";
          } else if (!userName) {
          $scope.validationMessage = "Please enter your name";
          } else {
          // Store username in local storage
          localStorage.setItem("name", userName);
          $location.path("/menu");
          }
      };
      });
      ```

      The loginController handles the login form by storing the user's name and email in $scope.user. When the user submits the form, the submitLogin function checks if the email includes an "@" and if the name is entered. If both are valid, it saves the name to the browser's local storage and redirects the user to the menu page. If not, it shows an error message.

7.  **Creating the Login View**

    - First, navigate to the views folder and edit the file named login.html. Then, paste the following code into it

   

{% highlight html%}
{% raw %}
<!-- login.html -->
<div
  class="relative h-screen bg-gradient-to-br bg-gray-800 flex justify-center items-center w-full flex-col"
>
  <div class="absolute top-6">
    <h1 class="text-4xl text-gray-50">Quiz</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="w-full sm:w-2/3 md:w-2/3 lg:w-1/3 bg-gray-700 rounded-lg">
    <div class="flex font-bold justify-center mt-6">
      <img
        class="h-20 w-20"
        src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sefyudem/Responsive-Login-Form/master/img/avatar.svg"
      />
    </div>
    <h2 class="text-3xl text-center text-gray-50 mb-4">Login Form</h2>
    <!-- validationMessage has to be between two curly braces {{validationMessage}} -->

    <h3 class="text text-red-600 text-center mb-4">{{validationMessage}}</h3>
    <div class="px-12 pb-10">
      <form ng-submit="submitLogin()">
        <div class="w-full mb-2">
          <div class="flex items-center">
            <i
              class="ml-3 fill-current text-gray-400 text-xs z-10 fas fa-user"
            ></i>
            <input
              type="text"
              placeholder="Username"
              autocomplete="off"
              ng-model="user.name"
              class="-mx-6 px-8 w-full border rounded px-3 py-2 text-gray-700 focus:outline-none"
            />
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="w-full mb-2">
          <div class="flex items-center">
            <i
              class="ml-3 fill-current text-gray-400 text-xs z-10 fas fa-lock"
            ></i>
            <input
              autocomplete="off"
              type="email"
              placeholder="Email"
              ng-model="user.email"
              class="-mx-6 px-8 w-full border rounded px-3 py-2 text-gray-700 focus:outline-none"
            />
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="flex items-center">
          <button
            type="submit"
            class="w-full py-2 rounded-full bg-indigo-600 focus:outline-none mt-2 mr-5 text-white"
          >
            Submit
          </button>
        </div>
      </form>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}



The login.html file presents a styled login form where users     can enter their username and email. The input fields are           connected to the loginController using ng-model. When the         form is submitted, it calls the submitLogin() function. If         there are any validation errors, they are displayed above         the form with {{validationMessage}}

![Login page](images/login.png)



8.  **Setting up the Menu Controller**

    - In the controllers folder, edit the file named     
    menuController.js with adding the following code

      ```Javascript
      // controllers/menuController.js
      angular.module("quizApp").controller("menuController", function ($scope, $location) {
      $scope.username = localStorage.getItem("name");

      if (!$scope.username) {
          $location.path("/");
      }

      $scope.date = new Date();

      $scope.categories = [
          { id: 9, name: "General Knowledge" },
          { id: 10, name: "Books" },
          { id: 11, name: "Film" },
          { id: 12, name: "Music" },
          { id: 13, name: "Musicals & Theatres" },
          { id: 14, name: "Television" },
          { id: 15, name: "Video Games" },
          { id: 16, name: "Board Games" },
          { id: 17, name: "Science & Nature" },
          { id: 18, name: "Computers" },
          { id: 19, name: "Mathematics" },
          { id: 20, name: "Mythology" },
          { id: 21, name: "Sports" },
          { id: 22, name: "Geography" },
          { id: 23, name: "History" },
          { id: 24, name: "Politics" },
          { id: 25, name: "Art" },
          { id: 26, name: "Celebrities" },
          { id: 27, name: "Animals" },
          { id: 28, name: "Vehicles" },
      ];

      $scope.difficulties = ["easy", "medium", "hard"];

      $scope.selectedCategory = null;
      $scope.selectedDifficulty = null;
      $scope.numberOfQuestions = 10;
      $scope.errorMessage = "";

      $scope.submit = function () {
          if (!$scope.selectedCategory || !$scope.selectedDifficulty) {
          $scope.errorMessage = "Please select a category and difficulty";
          } else {
          $scope.errorMessage = "";
          localStorage.setItem("category", $scope.selectedCategory);
          localStorage.setItem("difficulty", $scope.selectedDifficulty);
          localStorage.setItem("numberOfQuestions", $scope.numberOfQuestions);
          $location.path("/quiz");
          }
      };
      });
      ```

      The menuController ensures the user is logged in by retrieving the username from local storage. If not found, it redirects to the login page using $location.path("/"). It sets up lists of quiz categories and difficulties, and binds the user's selections to $scope variables. When the user submits their choices, the controller checks that both category and difficulty are selected. If valid, it saves these selections to local storage and navigates to the quiz page with $location.path("/quiz"). If not, it displays an error message by updating $scope.errorMessage.

9.  **Menu View**

    - Navigate to the views folder and edit the file named menu.html with pasting the following code into it
{% highlight html%}
{% raw %}
<!-- menu.html -->
<div class="bg-gray-800 flex justify-center items-center w-full h-screen">
  <!-- Welcome message -->
  <div class="absolute top-6">
    <h1 class="text-4xl text-white">Welcome {{username}}</h1>
    <h1 class=" pt-2 text-white text-center xl:pt-1">
      {{date | date:'fullDate'}}
    </h1>
  </div>
  <!-- end of welcome message -->

  <!-- Wrapper div for options -->
  <div
    class="p-10 bg-gray-700 rounded-xl flex flex-col gap-y-1 items-center justify-center"

-The menu.html file is connected to the menuController and uses AngularJS directives to handle user interactions. It displays a welcome message with the user's name and the current date. Users can select a quiz category and difficulty from dropdown menus, which are populated using ng-repeat to loop through the categories and difficulties arrays from the controller. The ng-model directive binds the selected values to $scope.selectedCategory and $scope.selectedDifficulty. There's also an input for the number of questions, bound to $scope.numberOfQuestions. If the user tries to submit without making all selections, an error message is shown using {{errorMessage}}. The submit button triggers the submit() function in the controller, which validates the inputs and navigates the user to the quiz page.

10.  **Quiz Controller**

        - Open the quizController.js file in the controllers folder and add the following code

      ```javascript
     // Quiz Controller
        app.controller("quizController", function ($scope, $http, $location) {
        $scope.username = localStorage.getItem("name");
      $scope.category = localStorage.getItem("category");
      $scope.difficulty = localStorage.getItem("difficulty");
      $scope.numberOfQuestions = localStorage.getItem("numberOfQuestions") || 10;
    
      if (!$scope.username) {
        $location.path("/");
      }
    
      $scope.questions = [];
      $scope.currentIndex = 0;
      $scope.score = 0;
      $scope.userAnswer = null;
      $scope.quizCompleted = false;
    
      // Fetch questions from the API
      var url =
        "https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=" +
        $scope.numberOfQuestions +
        "&category=" +
        $scope.category +
        "&difficulty=" +
        $scope.difficulty +
        "&type=multiple";
    
      $http.get(url).then(
        function (response) {
          if (response.data.results.length === 0) {
            $scope.errorMessage =
              "No questions available for the selected category and difficulty. Please try again.";
          } else {
            $scope.questions = response.data.results;
            // Decode HTML entities in questions and answers
            $scope.questions.forEach(function (question) {
              question.question = decodeHtml(question.question);
              question.correct_answer = decodeHtml(question.correct_answer);
              question.incorrect_answers =
                question.incorrect_answers.map(decodeHtml);
              question.allAnswers = question.incorrect_answers.concat(
                question.correct_answer
              );
              question.allAnswers = shuffleArray(question.allAnswers);
              // Also decode the allAnswers array
              question.allAnswers = question.allAnswers.map(decodeHtml);
            });
            $scope.currentQuestion = $scope.questions[$scope.currentIndex];
          }
        },
        function (error) {
          console.log("Error fetching questions", error);
        }
      );
    
      $scope.selectAnswer = function (answer) {
        $scope.userAnswer = answer;
      };
    
      $scope.submitAnswer = function () {
        if (!$scope.userAnswer) {
          alert("Please select an answer before proceeding.");
          return;
        }
    
        var correctAnswer = $scope.currentQuestion.correct_answer;
        if ($scope.userAnswer === correctAnswer) {
          $scope.score++;
        }
        $scope.userAnswer = null;
        $scope.currentIndex++;
        if ($scope.currentIndex < $scope.questions.length) {
          $scope.currentQuestion = $scope.questions[$scope.currentIndex];
        } else {
          $scope.quizCompleted = true;
        }
      };
    
      $scope.goToMenu = function () {
        $location.path("/menu");
      };
    
      $scope.logout = function () {
        localStorage.removeItem("name");
        localStorage.removeItem("category");
        localStorage.removeItem("difficulty");
        localStorage.removeItem("numberOfQuestions");
        $location.path("/");
      };
    
      function shuffleArray(array) {
        var currentIndex = array.length,
          temporaryValue,
          randomIndex;
    
        while (0 !== currentIndex) {
          randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * currentIndex);
          currentIndex--;
    
          temporaryValue = array[currentIndex];
          array[currentIndex] = array[randomIndex];
          array[randomIndex] = temporaryValue;
        }
    
        return array;
      }
    
      function decodeHtml(html) {
        var txt = document.createElement("textarea");
        txt.innerHTML = html;
        return txt.value;
      }
    });
      ```
      

The quizController uses AngularJS's $scope to manage and bind data such as the user's name, quiz settings, questions, and score to the view. It leverages the $http service to fetch quiz questions from the Open Trivia Database API. The controller employs $location to navigate between different routes, redirecting users to the login page if they're not authenticated or to the menu after logging out. Functions like submitAnswer, goToMenu, and logout are defined on $scope to handle user interactions, update the score, move to the next question, and manage navigation within the AngularJS framework.

11. **Quiz View**

- Open the file named `quiz.html` inside the `views` folder and add the following code:

{% highlight html%}
{% raw %}
<!-- quiz.html -->

The `quiz.html` file uses AngularJS directives to create an interactive quiz interface. It binds dynamic data like the current question, progress, score, and username using double curly braces. The `ng-if` directive displays the quiz questions or the results based on whether the quiz is completed. `ng-repeat` lists all answer options, and `ng-click` handles selecting and submitting answers. The `ng-class` directive highlights the selected answer. A progress bar visually shows the user's progress, and any errors, such as no available questions, are displayed using data binding.

## Conclusion

AngularJS was essential in building our quiz app. We organized the app using modules and controllers, used ngRoute for smooth navigation, and applied directives like ng-model, ng-repeat, ng-if, ng-click, and ng-class to handle data binding and user interactions. The $http service fetched quiz questions from an API, and $location managed page redirects. These AngularJS features made our application dynamic, interactive, and easy to navigate.
